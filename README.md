#Insight Data Engineering Code Challenge
**Performed in Python**

This is a Sudoku Puzzle Solver written in Python. The goal of the project is to produce a board with a correct solution as long as the board is valid. 

The only non-standard python library that is needed to run this program is the popular pandas library used for data analysis

The file can be executed as follows using the sample file contained in the repository:

`$ python solve_sudoku.py unsolved_puzzle.csv`

If you wish to solve another puzzle , simply, as in the above example replace unsolved_puzzle.csv with the name of the file containing your puzzle i.e. 

`$ python solve_sudoku.py [file name of csv containing your file]`

The correct board is output to the file called solved_puzzle.csv. This file is output to the same directory containing solve_sudoku.py
